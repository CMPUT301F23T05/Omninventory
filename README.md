### Running Issues

If you are running the app on an emulator attempt to open the camera to take an image, scan a barcode, or read a serial number, you may see this funny little guy instead of your actual webcam feed.

This is Android's default emulated webcam feed. It is possible to change it to your actual computer webcam (though seemingly not on MacOS):
1. Open Device Manager
2. Edit the device you are using to emulate the app
3. Click 'Show Advanced Settings'
4. Change the front and/or back cameras (whichever you are using) to 'Webcam' instead of 'Emulated'
5. Restart your emulator and relaunch the app.
